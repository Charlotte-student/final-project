# Directory of Foreign, Comparative, International Law Collections

## Project Description

This web site will contain a list of significant foreign, comparative, and international (FCIL) library collections, information, and librarian expertise in the   U.S. 

## Why Create the Directory?

By creating the directory, I will:

* supplement my capstone paper with a visual display of the information about FCIL collections that I have learned;
* create an informational web site for non-specialist librarians; and
* learn how to make a usable, informational web site.

I would also like to attach it to my LinkedIn profile as an example of my web development skills.
